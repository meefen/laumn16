## Professor Jekyll Wants You to Learn

Jekyll is a great blogging framework for hackers, but it's also the best way to learn git, Github, and collaboration.  We created Professor Jekyll as a foundational technology for teaching the practical and social aspects of coding.

## Professor Jekyll Knows Who You Are

Just set the `author` in your YAML and give the vitals in `_config.yml` and you're ready to go!  You can fill out students' author details yourself or use that process as a first lesson in forking and opening pull requests.

## Professor Jekyll Reads Your Code

Just like plain old Jekyll, Professor Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Prof')
#=> prints 'Hi, Prof' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
